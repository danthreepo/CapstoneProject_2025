## Data Cleaning & Transformations
**Column Standardization:**

Renamed `TITLE` â†’ `MOVIE NAME` for consistency across datasets.
Converted streaming platform columns (`NETFLIX`, `HULU`, etc.) from `0/1` to `True/False` for better readability.



**Formatting Adjustments:**  

Cleaned and adjusted all columns to uppercase, stripped white space, and replaced underscores with spaces.

Data frame 1 `[selected-genre].csv` uses a function to clean because the data loaded varies by selection.

Data frame 2 `MoviesOnStreamingPlatforms.csv.csv` is cleaned directly inline with the bulk code because it remains static when ran.

**Missing Data Handling:**  
Removed all rows with null values for each dataset individually.
Removed rows with null values after merging datasets to remove movies that would not be available on the streaming services.

**Dropped Unused Colounms:**  
Dropped these columns from Data Frame 1 `MOVIE ID`, `RUNTIME`, `DIRECTOR`, `DIRECTOR ID`, `STAR`, `STAR ID`, `VOTES`; and these from Data frame 2 `UNAMED: 0`,`ID`,`YEAR`,`AGE`, `TYPE`


## Notes
- These datasets were sourced from Kaggle and merged based on `MOVIE NAME`.
- Some movies might be missing from the merged dataset if they exist in only one source or if they were not available on the streaming services.
- Some movies may be classified under multiple genres
- Future improvements: Create a function that will run all of the genres independent of each other and score the streaming platforms based on those results.
- Other ideas: Take this data to find movies based on ratings to watch
