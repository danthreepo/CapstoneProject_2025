## üîπ Data Cleaning & Transformations
- **Column Standardization:**  
  - Renamed `TITLE` ‚Üí `MOVIE NAME` for consistency across datasets.
  - Converted streaming platform columns (`NETFLIX`, `HULU`, etc.) from `0/1` to `True/False` for better readability.
- **Missing Data Handling:**  
  - Removed rows with null values after merging datasets.
- **Formatting Adjustments:**  
  - Converted `ROTTEN TOMATOES` from a string (`98/100`) to a percentage (`98.0` as float) for analysis.

## üìç Notes
- The datasets were sourced from Kaggle and merged based on `MOVIE NAME`.
- Some movies might be missing from the merged dataset if they exist in only one source.
- Future improvements: Handle cases where movies have multiple genres.
